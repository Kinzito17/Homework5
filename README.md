# Homework5

<p> In this assignment I was tasked with building a working hours day planner. When the user visits the site they are presented with a color coordinated form that is organized by time. The user can select a time block and type a task they'd like to complete. When the user clicks the save button the information will be saved on the page.</p>

<p>Each time block is dynamic in that if the time block is in the past, present or future it will assume certain styling attributes.</p>

<p>Please find a link to the project below</p>
