# Homework5

<p> In this assignment I was tasked with building a working hours day planner. When the user visits the site they are presented with a color coordinated form that is organized by time. The user can select a time block and type a task they'd like to complete. When the user clicks the save button they information will be saved on the page.</p>

<p>Each time block is dynamic in that when if the time block has past it will assume certain styling same for the current and future time blocks.</p>

<p>Please find a link to the project below</p>
